 * reintroduces exactly the binary error the rounding is there to remove: `1.005 * 100` is
 * `100.49999999999999`, which rounds down, while `+'1.005e2'` is `100.5`, which rounds up.
 *
 * Splitting the exponent off first is what makes this total. The older form appended `'e' +
 * precision` to `num` directly, which assumed `num.toString()` never produces an exponent of
 * its own — but JavaScript switches to exponential notation below 1e-7 and at or above 1e21,
 * and `'1e-7' + 'e2'` is not a number at all (issue #36).
