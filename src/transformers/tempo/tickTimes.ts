/**
 * Where a recorded onset falls on the score grid.
 *
 * This is the tempo half of the reduction: it reads the `<tempo>` instructions already in the
 * MPM and converts each note's recorded millisecond onset into `tickDate`, and its recorded
 * duration into `tickDuration` — the only domain `<rubato>` and `<articulation>` can speak.
 *
 * It lives here, apart from the transformer that used to own it, because two callers need it
 * and neither should import the other: `TranslatePhysicalTimeToTicks`, which writes the values
 * onto the score, and `deriveResidual`, which computes them on a scratch copy to answer what
 * the MPM as it stands leaves unexplained.
 *
 * **The conversion is a function of the MPM *and* the recording, not of the MPM alone.** At every
 * tempo boundary the running millisecond cursor is re-anchored on the recorded onset of the note
 * that sits on it rather than on the tempo's own prediction. That keeps a segment's error from
 * accumulating into the next one — and it is why the tick domain cannot be recovered by inverting
 * a rendered performance, which has no recording to anchor to. Anyone tempted to replace this
 * with `performMsmToData` should read that sentence twice.
 *
 * The walk itself now lives in `placedTempos.ts`, which states that rule once for the four
 * callers that used to each carry their own copy of it.
