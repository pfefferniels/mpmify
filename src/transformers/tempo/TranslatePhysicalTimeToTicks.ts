   * The two extrapolations that answered them are gone from here, and not because they were
   * wrong: they were a third and fourth hand-copy of a rule `segmentAtMs` and
   * `dateAtMilliseconds` now state once. The first-segment copy measured from `ms` where the
   * cursor starts at `startMs`, and the last-segment copy read `@transition.to` straight off
   * the record — which is not the tempo the span arrives at when `@meanTempoAt` resolves the
   * transition away. Both now come out of the same two functions the note walk uses, so an
   * ornament and the notes it ornaments cannot be placed by different arithmetic.
