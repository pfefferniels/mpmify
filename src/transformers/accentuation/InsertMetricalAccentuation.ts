   * The loop counts beats as integers and converts each to ticks once, rather than
   * accumulating `beat += beatLength`. A triplet basis is not representable in binary, so the
   * accumulated position drifted — and `notesAtDate` compares dates with `===`, so a drifted
   * date silently matched no note at all. Rounding to the tick is exact for every basis,
   * because score dates are integers in ticks.
