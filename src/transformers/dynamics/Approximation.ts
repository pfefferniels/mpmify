 * (`tForDate`) and the cubic (`bezierPoint`) taken from espressivo rather than rewritten beside
 * it.
 *
 * The absent-target test is `??` and not truthiness, which is a fix rather than a translation: a
 * `@transition.to` of **0** — a dynamics fading to silence, a pedal lifting fully — is a real
 * target that the old `!instruction["transition.to"]` read as no transition at all, holding the
