 * - `InsertDynamicsGradient` and `InsertTemporalSpread` each fit half of one `<ornament>`, a
 *   velocity ramp and a roll. Written separately they would be two `<ornament>`s at one date,
 *   and the renderer would apply both.
 * - `InsertDynamicsInstructions` closes each fitted transition with a `<dynamics>` at the end of
 *   its window, and the next segment's fit lands on that same date. One element carries the
 *   closing volume and the next curve; two make the closer shadow the curve.
 *
 * A call at those two sites and nowhere else, deliberately. Merging on a matching date inside a
 * general insert would make a contract between two named transformers look like a property of
 * the format, and leave every other caller wondering whether its insert had silently landed
 * inside an existing element.
 *
 * A field the existing instruction already has a value for is left alone: the earlier
 * transformer's measurement wins.
