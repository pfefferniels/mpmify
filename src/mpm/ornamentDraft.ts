/**
 * The `ornamentDef` fields mpmify fits per instruction, before it knows which instructions
 * share a definition.
 *
 * **These are not `<ornament>` attributes.** Every one of them belongs on the def its
 * `@name.ref` points at — `transitionFrom`/`transitionTo` on a `<dynamicsGradient>`, the rest on
 * a `<temporalSpread>`. MPM has no place for them on the instruction, which is why espressivo's
 * `AddOrnamentOptions` has no field for them and why they cannot travel as part of one.
 *
 * They are still parked *on the element*, as attributes, and that is deliberate rather than
 * lazy. `InsertDynamicsGradient` writes the gradient half and `InsertTemporalSpread` the spread
 * half, at the same date, and {@link fillInAt} makes the two a single `<ornament>` — the element
 * is the only thing the two transformers share. A side table keyed by element would work until
 * something serialized the document between them, and the parking has to survive whatever
 * `TranslatePhyiscalTimeToTicks` does in between, which is to rewrite two of these fields.
 *
 * `StylizeOrnamentation` is the end of their life: it moves them into a real `<ornamentDef>` and
 * calls {@link clearOrnamentDraft}. A finished mpmify document carries none of them. If one
 * survives into a saved file, that is a bug in the chain and not a feature of the format.
 *
 * Field names are espressivo's, not the attributes' — these values are on their way into
 * `OrnamentDef.setTemporalSpreadValues` and `setDynamicsGradientValues`, and matching those
 * spellings is what keeps the hand-off from needing a translation step of its own.
