/**
 * Two notes of a chord, one played half as long as written, one twice.
 *
 * The played lengths are stated as what was recorded rather than as tick figures, because the
 * fitter derives the tick figures from the recording and the tempo. At 60bpm with a quarter-note
 * beat, 1000 ms is one quarter note is 720 ticks — so a note released 500 ms after it sounded is
 * the 360 ticks this used to assert directly, and one released after 2000 ms is the 1440.
 *
 * The rest note is there to make the piece long enough to contain them — or it was. The tick
 * walk used to measure a duration only where the note's end fell inside a tempo's span, and the
 * span reaches to `msm.end`, the last symbolic offset in the score; two chord notes alone put
 * that at 720 ticks, one second, so the note held for two ended past the end of the piece and was
 * measured as nothing at all. That is issue #27, and the last window runs open now, so the rest
 * no longer changes what these two notes measure. It stays because it also gives the piece a
 * second date, and the assertions below were recorded against a score that had one.

// Removed with the accumulated residual: this asserted that the fit divided its own definition
// back out of every note it covered, so the next step would measure against what the document
// now said. Nothing is written back any more — a later step derives the residual from the
// document itself — so there is no intermediate value left to assert. What the mechanism was
// for is covered by test/roundtrip's tier-1 case 'a uniform legato comes back as one def at
// that relativeDuration', which renders the fit and compares it against the performance it was
// fitted to.
