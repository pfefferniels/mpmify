/**
 * The warp has to agree with the renderer, and it did not.
 *
 * mpmify used to clamp `@lateStart` into [0, **0.9**] and `@earlyEnd` into [**0.1**, 1] — bounds
 * that exist nowhere in meico — and it left an inverted window inverted. meico (and espressivo's
 * `resolveRubato`, which is held equivalent to it) floors `lateStart` at 0, caps `earlyEnd` at 1,
 * and widens an inverted or empty window to the whole frame. The difference is not a rounding
 * one: on the frame below, four of these seven windows moved by up to 72 ticks, which is a tenth
 * of a quarter note.
 *
 * Every expectation here is what espressivo resolves the window to, evaluated at the midpoint of
 * a 720-tick frame with the identity intensity.
