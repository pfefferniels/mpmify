/**
 * mpmify never authors a non-finite attribute; it still reads one.
 *
 * `String(NaN)` is `'NaN'`, and `'NaN'` is a perfectly well-formed attribute value — the
 * document stays schema-valid while saying something no renderer can act on, and the fit that
 * produced it is several steps away by the time anyone notices.
 *
 * The guard is a **sweep**, not a check on the way in. It used to be the latter, which meant it
 * only saw values passed to one generic write method — so it also meant one had to exist. Now
 * `auditInstructions` walks the document and `AbstractTransformer.run` refuses afterwards, which
 * costs one pass per transformer and covers every path into the document, including a write
 * made straight through an espressivo map.
 *
 * It is mpmify's and not espressivo's because espressivo's interior is frozen at
 * logs-and-returns by its own RULE E1: throwing there would be a divergence from the library it
 * is held byte-equivalent to.
 *
 * Reading is deliberately not symmetrical: files written before the guard existed contain such
 * values, and refusing to parse them would make old work unopenable rather than diagnosable.
