/**
 * Pedalling — and why this is not a round-trip case.
 *
 * Every case in `cases.ts` states a truth in MPM, renders it, and asks whether the chain can
 * recover it. That only means something where the chain *fits* something. `InsertPedal` does
 * not: its own doc comment calls it "a shortcut", and it takes the shape of the movement —
 * `start`, `duration`, `direction`, `depth` — as constructor options rather than reading it off
 * the recording. A round trip would therefore compare a truth this file wrote against a fit
 * whose shape this file also dictated, and measure nothing but the option-picking. That is
 * precisely the failure mode the harness is built to exclude, so it is excluded here too.
 *
 * What is worth asserting is everything downstream of the shortcut: that the movements land
 * where the pedal is, that the document is structurally sound, and — the part no unit test can
 * see — that the renderer actually produces a pedal from it.
