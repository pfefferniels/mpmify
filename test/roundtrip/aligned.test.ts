/**
 * The round trip on a real recording — issue #51.
 *
 * The rest of this directory states its ground truth as an MPM, which makes the truth exact and
 * a perfect fit possible in principle. This case does not: the truth is a Welte roll, and the
 * chain fitting it is the one a person actually wrote for this passage, call for call. What it
 * measures is therefore not "can the fitter invert the renderer" but "does the pipeline still
 * reproduce a performance it has been used on" — which is the property all four criticals of the
 * 2026-08 audit broke while every unit test stayed green.
 *
 * The bounds are recorded from measurement, not chosen. Whatever they admit above zero is a
 * measured gap, and the notes below say what is inside them today. Tightening one is what fixed
 * looks like; loosening one without a reason is the regression this file exists to catch.

   * notes of a chord into a single `<articulation noteid="#a #b">`, which names no note,
   * so every articulation on a chord was inert.
   *
   * What is left is mostly not a defect. The 20 notes an `<articulation>` covers are 83 ms out
   * on average; the 36 the reconstruction never articulated are 207 ms out and hold all six
   * worst notes, because nothing in the chain was ever asked to shorten them. Tightening this
