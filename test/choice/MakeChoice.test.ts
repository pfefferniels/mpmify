/**
 * `MakeChoice` collapses the several readings of a passage down to one.
 *
 * It used to do both halves of that by splicing out of the array it was walking. For the notes
 * that was only expensive — an `indexOf` scan and a tail shift per note, quadratic in the score.
 * For the pedals it was wrong: splicing out of the array a `for…of` is iterating skips the
 * element that slides into the freed slot, so two adjacent pedals from the rejected source left
 * the second one behind. See issue #49.
